# SystemD

> Increasingly, Linux distributions are adopting or planning to adopt the `systemd` init system. 
This powerful suite of software can manage many aspects of your server, 
 from services to mounted devices and system states. [^1]

 
## Concepts 
 
### Unit
 
 > In `systemd`, a `unit` refers to any resource that the system knows how to operate on and manage.
  This is the primary object that the `systemd` tools know how to deal with. 
  These resources are defined using configuration files called **unit files**. [^1]
