# Global Shared Library

https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/

When you're making pipelines on Jenkins you will run into the situation that you will want to stay [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
To share pipeline code there are several ways.

* *SCM:* Have a pipeline dsl script in a SCM and load it from there
* *Plugin:* A Jenkins plugin that you can call via the pipeline dsl
* *Global Workflow Library:* There is a global library for pipeline dsl scripts in the Jekins master **Preferred solution**

Please read the [documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) to get a basic idea.

!!! danger
    When using a Global Library you will always have to import something from this library.
    This doesn't make sense when you online use functions (via the vars folder).
    In this case, you have to import nothing, which you do via: "_"


```java
@Library('FlussoGlobal')
import nl.flusso.Utilities
```

```java
@Library('FlussoGlobal') _
```


## Library Directory structure

The directory structure of a shared library repository is as follows:

    (root)
     +- src                     # Groovy source files
     |   +- org
     |       +- foo
     |           +- Bar.groovy  # for org.foo.Bar class
     +- vars
     |   +- foo.groovy          # for global 'foo' variable/function
     |   +- foo.txt             # help for 'foo' variable/function
     +- resources               # resource files (external libraries only)
     |   +- org
     |       +- foo
     |           +- bar.json    # static helper data for org.foo.Bar

The `src` directory should look like standard Java source directory structure.
This directory is added to the classpath when executing Pipelines.

The `vars` directory hosts scripts that define global variables accessible from
Pipeline scripts.
The basename of each `*.groovy` file should be a Groovy (~ Java) identifier, conventionally `camelCased`.
The matching `*.txt`, if present, can contain documentation, processed through the system’s configured markup formatter
(so may really be HTML, Markdown, etc., though the `txt` extension is required).

The Groovy source files in these directories get the same “CPS transformation” as your Pipeline scripts.

A `resources` directory allows the `libraryResource` step to be used from an external library to load associated non-Groovy files.
Currently this feature is not supported for internal libraries.

Other directories under the root are reserved for future enhancements.

## Configure libraries in Jenkins

The a Jenkins Master you can configure the Global Pipeline Libraries.

You can find this in: Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Global Pipeline Libraries

You can configure multiple libraries, where the there is a preference for Git repositories.
You can select a default version (for example: the master branch), and either allow or disallow overrides to this.

To be able to use a different version, you would use the @<OtherBranch> in case of Git.

```java
@Library('FlussoGlobal@my-feature-branch')
```

## HelloWorld Example

* Create Git repository (see below for structure)
* Configure this Git repository as an "Global Pipeline Libraries" entry
  * Name: FlussoGlobal
  * Default Version: master
  * Modern SCM: git
  * Project repository: git@gitlab.flusso.nl:CICD/jenkins-pipeline-library.git
* Create the resources you want in the git repository
* Use the library in a pipeline

### Util Class (class) Example

```groovy
#!/usr/bin/groovy
#/src/nl/flusso/Utilities.groovy
package nl.flusso

import java.io.Serializable

class Utilities implements Serializable {
  def steps

  Utilities(steps) {this.steps = steps}

  def sayHello(String name) {
    steps.sh "echo $name"
  }
}
```

```groovy
@Library('FlussoGlobal')
import nl.flusso.Utilities

def utils = new Utilities(steps)

node {
    String name = 'Joost'
    utils.sayHello(name)
}
```

### Util method (var) Example
```groovy
#!/usr/bin/groovy
#/vars/sayHello.groovy
def call(name) {
    // you can call any valid step functions from your code, just like you can from Pipeline scripts
    echo "Hello world, ${name}"
}
```

```groovy
@Library('FlussoGlobal') _
node {
    String name = 'Joost'
    sayHello name
}
```


## Combining libraries

Lets say you want to want to have a core library and multiple specific libraries that utilize these. There are several to do this, we will show two.

### Import both

One way is to explicitly import both libraries in the Jenkinsfile.

```groovy
@Library(['github.com/joostvdg/jenkins-pipeline-lib','github.com/joostvdg/jenkins-pipeline-go']) _
```

Con:

* you have to import all the required libraries yourself

Pro:

* you can specify the versions of each

### Implicit Import + Explicit Import

You can also configure the core (in this case jenkins-pipeline-lib) as "loaded implicitly".
This will make anything from this library available by default.

Be careful with the naming of the vars though!

The resulting Jenkinsfile would then be.

```groovy
@Library('github.com/joostvdg/jenkins-pipeline-go') _
```
