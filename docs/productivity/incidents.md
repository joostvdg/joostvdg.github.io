## Notes

* most incidents happen near updates/upgrades/deployments
    * make deployments a non-event
    * small increments, high frequency, automated, tested
* it is not systems, it not humans, but humans within systems
    * human will make mistakes
    * processes are (almost) always part of the problem
    * automation needs to include sanity checks (ranges of sane values)
