description: Tanzu Application Platform GitOps Installation Next Steps

# Next Steps

If you've followed along and installed TAP with GitOps in the Build, Run, and View cluster, you might wonder what is next?

We have prepared some next steps of things that often see customers do:

* [Run Cluster deploying applications with ArgoCD](/tanzu/tap-gitops/run-with-argocd/)
* [Finalize the GitOps Flow for the Applications](/tanzu/supplychain/gitops-flow/)
* [Configure GitLab Integrations in TAP GUI](/tanzu/tap-gui/gitlab-integration/)
* [TAP GUI TechDocs hosted with MinIO](/tanzu/tap-gui/techdocs-minio/)
* [More Supply Chain Customizations Are Coming](/tanzu/supplychain/overview/)
