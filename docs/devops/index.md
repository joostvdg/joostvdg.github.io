# DevOps Assessment

How can I assess an organisation for what to do next.

## Questions

* To which extent can your development teams request/create an environment on their own, without going through lengthy approval processes?
* To which extent can your development teams use pre-configured/ template tool sets (e.g. Jenkins master jobs, master POM etc) which they can extend and/or modify to their needs?
* To which extent can your developments teams deploy to any environment (including production)? If not, what do they lack: knowledge or passwords to higher environments?
* Does your system of record provide you tractability from idea to production?
* How tightly coupled are your key delivery pipeline tools? 
    * Is it easy to replace them?
* Do you have different release management activities based on application blocks?
    * Who is keeping it up-to-date?
